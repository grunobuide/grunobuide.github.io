            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div id="hiding1">
            <p>Hello! I'm Bruno, an early-career developer passionate about creating software solutions that make a positive impact. My journey began at the University of São Paulo, where I graduated in Literature and dove into the world of linguistics. During my studies, I discovered my interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which led me to complete a master's and a doctorate in the field.</p>

            <p>My academic experience provided me with a solid foundation in NLP and allowed me to develop skills in areas such as data annotation, ontology design, and data evaluation. In addition, I had the opportunity to work on challenging projects, such as the automatic detection of hate speech on social networks.</p>
            
            <p>After completing my doctorate, I decided to apply my knowledge in corporate environments. I worked as a computational linguistics specialist at Stilingue, where I was responsible for defining goals in the area, annotating data, and improving the company's NLP system. I then took on the role of team leader, managing projects and leading software development teams.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I am a chapter leader at Blip, where I lead multidisciplinary product development teams. My responsibilities include project management, people development, and strategic planning.</p></section>

            <p> In Brazil it is very usual for academics to have their curriculum at this platform called Lattes, <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/0883092380904264" target="_blank">here is the link of my page there</a>. It is a little outdated but I find it a good way to check out the academic landscape in which I studied.</p>

            <p>I personally prefer to keep my CV updated in a less standartized way, so that I can highlight my professional experiences and skills in a more straightforward way, <a href="./[EN] Bruno Ferrari Guide - Currículo 2024 (1).pdf" target="_blank">here you can find the link</a> to my CV.</p>

            <p>I've used to cohost a podcast about language and linguistics, the link is here (the podcast is in Portuguese). <a href="https://babelpodcast.medium.com/" target="_blank">You can find it here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>You can find both my <a href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/8/8139/tde-19122016-100651/en.php" target="_blank">masters thesis</a> and my <a href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/8/8139/tde-08122022-174035/en.php" target="_blank">PhD dissertation</a> on those links, they were written in Brazilian Portuguese and are available for free in the University of Sao Paulo system.</p>
