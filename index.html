            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Bruno, an early-career developer passionate about creating software solutions that make a positive impact. My journey began at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, where I graduated in Literature and dove into the world of linguistics. During my studies, I discovered my interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which led me to complete a master's and a doctorate in the field.</p>

            <p>My academic experience provided me with a solid foundation in NLP and allowed me to develop skills in areas such as data annotation, ontology design, and data evaluation. In addition, I had the opportunity to work on challenging projects, such as the automatic detection of hate speech on social networks.</p>
            
            <p>After completing my doctorate, I decided to apply my knowledge in corporate environments. I worked as a computational linguistics specialist at Stilingue, where I was responsible for defining goals in the area, annotating data, and improving the company's NLP system. I then took on the role of team leader, managing projects and leading software development teams.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I am a chapter leader at Blip, where I lead multidisciplinary product development teams. My responsibilities include project management, people development, and strategic planning.</p></section>
